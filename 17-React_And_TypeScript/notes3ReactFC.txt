==================
A note on React FC 
===================

Why React.FunctionComponent<{}> is deprecated

const Greeter: React.FC = () => {
  return <h1> Hello World </h1>
}

It's something you'll likely run into in older code
bases, and other courses, but using 

function Greeter(): JSX.Element {
    return <h1> Hello World </h1> 
}

Is what's normally used currently
