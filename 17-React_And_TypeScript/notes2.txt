=========================================
Our first React Component with TypeScript
=========================================

We're going to start with functional components, 
although class components are still used sometimes

But for demo purposes, we're going to utilize 
functional components

First create a components directory in the src 
folder, and the first component will be a basic 
one, a greeter function, so in the components
folder create Greeter.tsx file 

And after creating this the first thing we 
always need to do is at the top of the 
file add: 

import React from "react";

Then let's create our function 

function Greeter(){
return <h1>Hello there!</h1>
}

export default Greeter;

So right now the above is a valid, albeit very 
basic react component. Nothing TypeScripty about 
it at all, no type annotations, no 
generics

Next go to the main App.tsx file and add: 

import Greeter from './components/Greeter';

Then in the App component add <Greeter /> 
inside the div add a few: 


function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.tsx</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://reactjs.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Learn React Luke
        </a>
        <Greeter />
        <Greeter />
        <Greeter />
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}


So now on the main page we see three h1's saying 
Hello there! rendered.

Very simple, and this is identical to the react you've 
seen before, BUT and an emphasized but, if we hover 
over the <Greeter /> we see the following: 

(alias) function Greeter(): JSX.Element 

So that func returns a JSX.Element type, that's a 
type that we get automatically when we ran 
that initial React + TypeScript setup at the 
beginning, we didn't need to do it ourselves, it was 
already in the type definitions

And if we right click then click view type definitions
we can view it in the index.d.ts file

But if we wanted to be explicit about the return 
type, we can and probably should do that, so 
inside the Greeter.tsx file, annotate the return 
type 

import React from "react"; 

function Greeter(): JSX.Element {
    return <h1>Hello there!</h1>
}

export default Greeter;

So now we've explicitly annotated inside the Greeter 
component what the return type needs to be
