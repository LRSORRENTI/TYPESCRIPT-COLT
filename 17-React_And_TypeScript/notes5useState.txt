========================
useState With TypeScript
========================

Okay let's introduce some state, we're using 
hooks

So instead of the hard coded array of items: 

const items = [
    {id: 1, productName: "Eggs", quantity: 12},
    {id: 2, productName: "Milk", quantity: 1},
    {id: 3, productName: "Protein Powder", quantity: 1}
]

We're going to create an array in the beginning, 
then we'll get back from useState then, useState 
gives a func to update that peice of state so at the 
top we also need to import useState: 

import React, {useState} from 'react'
