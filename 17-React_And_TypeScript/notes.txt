====================
React & TypeScript
====================

Just like we saw with lodash, React also has type 
definitions, there are types that we can add 
to a React app we plan on building 

Types for react component elements, 
function component elements, class 
component types, lot's of type definitions

And usually we'll use create-react-app command 
to set up our React application

To set up a TS + React app run the following 
command: 

npx create-react-app my-appName --template typescript 

and voila, and it's the --template typescript that 
is the main flag we must include to set up the 
TS + React project

There are ways to add TS types a different way 
with command flags @types/node or @types/react-dom etc.. 

But create-react-app my-AppName --template typescript
is the go-to
