OKAY I'M GOING TO TRY THIS AGAIN, THIS 
TIME USING THE EXACT SAME DEPENDENCIES AS 
COLT, AND IF I RUN INTO THE SAME ERROR I'LL 
KNOW FOR SURE IT WAS A MISTAKE I MADE, NOT 
BECAUSE I'M USING DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF DEPENDENCIES

COLT IS USING: 

"dependencies": {
    "lite-server": "^2.6.1",
    "lodash": "^4.17.21"
}, 
"devDependencies": {
    "@types/lodash": "^4.14.182",
    "ts-loader": "^9.3.0",
    "typescript": "^4.7.4",
    "webpack": "^5.73.0",
    "webpack-cli": "^4.10.0"
}
