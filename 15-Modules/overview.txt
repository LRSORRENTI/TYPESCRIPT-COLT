TypeScript Modules
====================

This section we're going over modules, which 
are ways to share code b/w files, which 
historically has been a tedious thing to 
do in JS, there was commonJS, esModule syntax, 
the landscape of modules is a fractured one

But it's crucial to understand, 
TS supports modules, it allows us to 
share code b/w files, also 
allows us to control the output it generates

But first let's go over: 

===============================
TYPESCRIPT NAMESPACES
===============================

This has to do w/ organizing code, 
it's a module format that's TS specific, 
is pre-dates the ES modules standard, on the Docs, 
there's an overview of it 

But the good news is that it's not as common as 
it was in the past

In TypeScript, a namespace is a way to organize
 code into logical groups, similar to how modules 
 work in other programming languages.
 
  Namespaces can contain functions, classes,
   interfaces, and other types of declarations,
    and they can be nested inside other 
    namespaces to create a hierarchical structure.

The main purpose of namespaces is to
 prevent naming collisions between 
 different parts of a codebase. 
 
 By wrapping related code inside a
  namespace, you can ensure that
   its identifiers don't clash with 
   similarly named entities in other
    parts of the program.

However, namespaces have some
 drawbacks that led to their 
 replacement by ES modules in 
 modern TypeScript code.
 
  One major issue is that namespaces 
  can be difficult to manage and 
  scale as a project grows larger,
   especially when multiple developers 
   are working on the same codebase. 
   
   Additionally, namespaces can lead to
    issues with circular dependencies 
    and can make it harder to understand
     the structure of a codebase.

ES modules, on the other hand,
 provide a standardized way to
  import and export code between
   different files, making it 
   easier to manage dependencies 
   and create a more modular codebase. 
   
   ES modules are part of the JavaScript 
   language specification, which means
    that they are widely supported 
    across modern browsers and
     runtime environments.

In summary, namespaces in 
TypeScript provide a way to 
organize code and prevent naming
 collisions, but they have 
 limitations in terms of scalability
  and complexity. ES modules provide
   a more modern and standardized 
   way to manage dependencies
    and create modular code,
     which is why they have
      largely replaced namespaces
       in modern TypeScript code.

       ===========================
       Working with modules
       ===========================

       So namespaces are the old way, and the 
       new way we share code across files is with 
       modules, using the import and export keywords 

       So if we omit the import / export keywords, 
       TS assumes the code in the file should be 
       globally available aka global scope

       Any file without an export or a top level await 
       should be considered a script and not a module

So in the index.ts, we have add() and sample() both 
available, because in our utilityExample.ts file 
we haven't used export on those funcs, once we prefix 
the export keyword to those functions, they are no longer 
available globally, unless we use the import keyword to 
bring them into specific files

also note we can change the module syntax when compiling 
with tsc, in the tsconfig.json we would change 
"module": "commonjs" to "module": "ES6", there is auto 
complete in the tsconfig as well, a list of options availabke 
to change to


Right now we've been executing with node, but let's say 
we want to do something in the browser, so let's 
add an index.html

And after opening up live server, the console shows the 
following error: 

index.js:8 Uncaught ReferenceError: exports is not defined

So what's happening is the browser doesn't know 
about commonjs modules, it doesn't know about the 
'export' keyword, that worked fine when we executed 
with node 

Right now our code is just not browser compatible 

There are tools to use if we wanted like webpack, 
requireJS, there are tools to use to make the code run 
but it will not work as is 

So what we do is go back in the tsconfig.json file 
and change the module setting to ES6
 
 But it still won't be browser compatible after changing 
 it to ES6, to fix this we must do this in the script 
 tag: 

 <script type="module" src="./dist/index.js"></script>

 Also right now, Colt's did not work, but he's not using 
 live-server, so there was an additional error, however 
 he just ran npm install lite-server, which is comparable 
 to live-server, and it works, it worked for me right 
 away since I have live-server, but if I hypothetically 
 just opened the index.html in the browser w/o live server 
 I get the same error colt just did
