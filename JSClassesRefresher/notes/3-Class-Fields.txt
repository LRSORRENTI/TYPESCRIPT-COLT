====================
Class Fields 
====================

Usually with classes we'll want default 
properties, or fields, to add them to our 
classes, we put them outside / before the 
constructor function: 



class Player{
    score = 0;
    numLives = 10; 
    constructor(first, last){
        this.first = first;
        this.last = last;
    }
}

So now, every new instantiation of player will 
always start with a score of 0, and numLives of 10

Important to note, this is only for values that 
should always be there at the start, obviously 
we need arguments of player name and any other unique 
values to be passed in to the constructor func
