      <h2 class="mt-4 text-center"><u>What is TypeScript?</u></h2>
      <p>
        To answer this question, we need to talk JavaScript. JavaScript has a
        few quirks, shortcomings, oddities. Like 'null * 213' returns 0, or
        multiply 'undefined * 8976', or if we try to access a property of an
        object that doesn't exist, JS says 'undefined', it doesn't throw any
        errors, just throws unexpected undefined
      </p>
      <p>
        The quirks are many because JS was created very quickly, just to add
        some scripting. But JS now is a behemoth, it's THE browser language.
      </p>
      <p>
        TypeScript improves upon JS by adding 'TYPES', TypeScript is known as a
        'superset' of JS, meaning all JS code is considered valid, the
        difference is TypeScript adds types
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="mt-4 text-center"></h2>
      <p>
        So what does all this actually mean? Well TypeScript performs something
        called 'Static Checking', which is a feature of many other programming
        languages, but essentially it means that it will detect errors in our
        code without running it
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn't actually execute our code, that's JavaScripts job, TypeScript
        is a static type checker, which means it does this 'pre-runtime'
        checking on the basis of types, or the 'types of data' in our program,
        it knows if something is a number, or boolean, or string, or an array,
        or object.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why does this matter? The main reason is that it greatly helps
        identifying errors in our code, and more importantly it helps identify
        them BEFORE our code even runs, it analyzes what we do as we type, and
        only exists in development, it will become regular JavaScript that can
        run in the browser, or node.js

    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="mt-4 text-center">
        <b> <u> Installing TypeScript </u></b>
      </h2>
      <p>So let's get TypeScript installed</p>
      <p>
        After running via npm, we can use npm to install TypeScript globally,
        this means that you can use the tsc command anywhere in your terminal.
        To do this, run npm install -g typescript. This will install the latest
        version (currently 4.8).
      </p>
      <p>
        Also we can use the TypeScript playground on the official
        typescriptlang.org link, many sections of the course can be practiced
        entirely in this playground if so desired
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >Also please REFER to the official website as often as possible! It
          has amazing documentation with examples, and is a great tool to
          supplement your learning

    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="mt-4 text-center">
        <b><u>How we use TypeScript</u></b>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Let's discuss how we'll use TS in this course and the basic workflow
        we'll follow
      </p>
      <p>
        First off we need to create a .ts file, similar to how a JavaScript file
        ends in like script.js
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a second extension we'll be using later, that being '.tsx', and
        we'll go over this more when we get to React + TypeScript together
      </p>
      <p>
        .tsx refers to being able to write 'jsx' syntax, and we'll be going over
        all of that more thoroughly once we get to our react sectiom
      </p>
      <p>
        So even just typing in Math.round() into our TS file, TS is saying 'we
        expected an argument here and there's nothing'
      </p>
      <p>
        So much of TypeScript is not executing or compiling a file, it's the
        ingredients phase, TS will display errors way before we even put our
        ingredients together and try to cook them
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a second part to this though, after running tsc basics.js our JS
        file is auto updated and includes the compiled code
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >QUICK NOTE HERE, I'M HAVING SOME TROUBLE USING THE POWERSHELL IN
          VSCODE, I THINK THERE'S SOME KIND OF ACCESS RESTRICTION GOING ON BUT
          THE 'TSC' COMMAND IS WORKING FINE IN GIT BASH AND IS AUTO-UPDATING ON
          VSCODE, FOR NOW I'LL JUST USE GIT BASH TO USE THE 'TSC' COMMAND,
          TROUBLESHOOT THESE ACCESS ERROR MESSAGES IN VSCODE POWERSHELL LATER
        </b>
      </p>
      <p class="h2">
        <b
          >So in a nutshell: Writing TypeScript is like using a spell-check for
          our code, and the 'tsc' command is what compiles our TS, two step
          process, write TS in our ide, then in git bash or command line type
          tsc + filename.ts
        </b>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container mt-4">
      <h2 class="text-center">
        <u> <b> Our first type annotation </b> </u>
      </h2>
      <p>
        So we've established the obvious point that there are types in
        TypeScript, there are many of these types and we'll dive into all of
        them
      </p>
      <p>
        But first let's talk about where we apply types in our TypeScript code
        there's many different situations from things like functions, i.e: this
        function must return a boolean, or an array of booleans, or a number,
        string, you get the idea
      </p>
      <p>
        We can also say 'This function accepts two numbers and returns one
        number'
      </p>
      <p>
        We can get very detailed about the patterns, shapes of objects, like
        this object must have a specific property called 'colors', and 'colors'
        must be set to an array of strings
      </p>
      <p>
        Or we can do something very simple by saying 'hey TS, this variable is a
        string'
      </p>
      <p>
        We can do this very easily, all we do is 'const myVariable: string = "so
        awesome!"'
      </p>
      <p>
        And after running the tsc command our JS file will display ' const
        myVariable = "so awesome!"'
      </p>
      <p>We just added a type! This is called <b>TYPE ANNOTATION</b></p>
      <p>The syntax is: let myVar: type = value</p>
      <p>And the type is always lowercase, no capital S for string</p>
      <p>
        Also we can reassign variables is TS if it's the same type, for ex we
        could do 'myVariable = "TypeScript is awesome"' and our variable from
        earlier updates, similar to how 'let' works in JS
      </p>
      <p>
        For ex: let movieTitle: string = "Amadeus"; movieTitle = "Arrival"
       <p>
        Now movieTitle = Arrival, but if we change it to be 
        a number 
       </p>
       <p>
        movieTitle = 9
       </p>
      </p>
      <p>Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.</p>
      <p>
        So TS is fine with us changing movieTitle from Amadeus to Arrival, but
        once we try to change movieTitle to a number, TS throws the error
      </p>
      <p>
        Something similar happens if we try 
        to use a method on the wrong data type, 
        like trying to use .toUpperCase on a number 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container mt-4">
      <h2 class="text-center"><u>
        Working with numbers and booleans</u></h2>
        <p>
           So just like in JS we have a number data type, 
           some languages have things like 'floats' ,'int' and 
           others but in TypeScript as well as JavaScript numbers 
           are just numbers
        </p>
        <p>
          In TS we use the type annotation 'number' all lowercase
        </p>
        <p>
          When we tell TS 'this specific variable is a number, it should 
          always be a number, the number can be reassigned, but it must 
          be a number'
        </p>
        <p>
          We also have 'boolean' as a type, that's the same concept as number, 
          'boolean' must be lowercase, and if the value of the variable 
          changes from true to false, that's fine, but it must be a boolean
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p class="h3">Let's look at an example of where TS will throw an 
        error in the terminal when we try to compile the TS file into JS:
      </p>
      <p>
      le`
</p>
      <p class="h2">
    Okay so PowerShell is working now, after running tsc variables.ts, in the terminal 
  following is displayed:
      </p>
      <p>
        variables.ts:9:1 - error TS2322: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.
</p>
<p>
9 gameOver = "true"
  ~~~~~~~~
  </p>
      <p>
        Also as a note the compiled JS is using 'var' instead of 'let'
        which we can configure later, but for now let's roll with var
      </p>
      <p>
        But the main takeaway from this section is that we use tsc + filename.ts in 
        our terminal, then we'll get a compiled js file from that ts file, 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="text-center"><u>Type Inference</u></h2>
      <p>
        Let's go over type Inference, type inference refers to the 
        TypeScript compilers ability to infer types from certain values 
        in your code.
      </p>
      <p>
        TypeScript can remember a value's type even if you didn't provide 
        a type annotation, and will enforce that original type set to 
        that variable from then on. Ex:
      </p>
      <p>
        //Creating a variable with a value but without type annotation
      </p>
      <p>
        let x = 27
      </p>
      <p>
        x = "twenty-seven"
      </p>
      <p>
        //ERROR - Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the time when we write a variable, we can rely on 
        type inference, but there ARE situations where we must annotate 
        variables, and we'll learn more about that later
      </p>
      <p>
      //type inference
      </p>
      <p>
let tvShow = "Initial D";
</p>
<p>
tvShow = "Breaking Bad"
</p>
<p>
//no problem, tvShow is now breaking bad
</p>
<p>
tvShow = false
</p>
<p>
//problem, Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string'.ts(2
      </p>
      <p>
        Above we did not use type inference, we could've but 
        we let TS infer it for us.
      </p>

        The type: 'Any':

      <p class="h3 mt-3">
