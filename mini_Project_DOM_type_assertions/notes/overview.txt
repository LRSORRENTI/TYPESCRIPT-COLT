This section we'll be building a mini-project,
things to know and keep in mind when building a project

There will be some lecture as well with 
non-null assertion operator, DOM manipulation, 
and set up a simple to-do list project with a 
server

First though, in our project in vscode, let's 
run the command 'tsc --init' to create the tsconfig.json 
file in the project

Then create an src folder for all TS files, then 
a dist folder to house the compiled JS files

Next go into the json config and uncomment 
outDir and set it to the dist folder, that way 
all compiled JS will be returned into that 
specific folder 

At the bottom on the config.json add a commma 
and use "include": ["src"] which houses all the 
TS files
