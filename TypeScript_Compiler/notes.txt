In this section we'll learn to configure the TS 
compiler

In order to change TS config, from the terminal in 
VS code or bash, in the TS file / folder run:

tsc --init

this will create a tsconfig.json file, 
and inside our tsconfig.json file 
there's a lot, over 100 commented and some 
uncommented settings

Accompanied by explanations of what each 
setting for a particular config does,
this is where we can modify how TS behaves 
during compilation

=======================

WATCH MODE 

========================

Watch mode is a command we can add to the 
tsc command: 

tsc -w index.ts

OR: 

tsc --watch index.ts 

This will make TS actively monitor the index.ts file, 
and TS will watch for any file changes that occur

==============

AS A NOTE, IT'S EASIER TO SEE IN VSCODE
 INTEGRATED TERMINAL






 ==============================

 WORKING WITH MULTIPLE FILES

 ==============================

We can also work with multiple files 

Let's add another file to demonstrate working 
with more than one TS file, which is much more common 
working on an actual team for a job that 
uses TS

Inside the folder, if we want to compile multiple 
files, instead of appending: tsc index.ts
which will only compile that one ts file 
we can just run tsc on it's own: 

tsc 

Make sure you're in the correct folder, since 
running tsc on it's own will compile every ts file 
inside of that folder

We can configure that tsc command to ignore a specific 
file, and compile all the other TS files, one 
way to do this is with the TS option called :

# Files - files

On the docs, under project configuration there's 
tsconfig reference,

Important to note files is known as a top level compiler 
option, so it does outside of the compiler 
options json object: 

So in our tsconfig.json file, OUTSIDE the 
 "compilerOptions": {} we add a comma then 

 "files": [index.ts, test.ts, example.ts] }

now tsc will ignore any other ts files inside of 
our folder, so if we had index2.ts in addition 
to index.ts, test.ts, and example.ts but 
we didn't want it to be compiled, using 
that json notation and excluding index2.ts, it would not 
be included when running tsc

============================

ANOTHER WAY TO ACCOMPISH TSC FILE compilation:

INCLUDE & EXCLUDE
