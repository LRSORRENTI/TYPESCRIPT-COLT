==========================

Just as a note, I think the reason lite-server wasnt't 
working yesterday had something to do with the 
structure of the index.html, today I had the exact 
same error message: 

favicon error: 

 404 (Not Found)" |
  "http://127.0.0.1:47021/favicon.ico"

  ===========================

  But after adding an h1 to the body, error goes 
  away immediately after saving the index.html with 
  the new h1 tag.... 

  Idk, maybe lite-server needs at least a single 
  html element to display the console.log's 
  I added in the index.ts? B/c it was compiling 
  into the dist from the src on save... so yeah 
  idk 
  
  Working now, If I have that error in the future I 
  guess I'll try to add html elements and see 
  if that truly was the solution
