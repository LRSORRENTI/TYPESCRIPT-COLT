# TYPESCRIPT-COLT STEELE
This will be my repo for Colt Steele's TypeScript course.
=========================================================
Going to update the README.md later, but for now I'm 
planning on learning TypeScript the best I can, 
I know a little about TS, and I know JS decently 
well so I'm looking forward to this course.
=========================================================
Will be cloning the empty repo down to auto-set the 
remote, then adding, committing and pushing as 
frequently as I can
