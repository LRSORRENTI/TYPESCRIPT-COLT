=============================
TYPE ALIASES
=============================

Next up let's go over type ALIASES, this is how we can re-use 
a type and give it a name, we often do this with 
more compicated types like object types

Instead of writing object types in an annotation, 
we can declare them separately in a TYPE ALIAS, 
which will simply be the desired shape of 
the object

This helps make our TS code more readable 
and reusable elswehere in our code!

===================================================

EXAMPLE: 

// Type alias below!

type Person = {
    name: string; 
    age: number;
};

// Use the type alias in the annotation

const sayHappyBirthday = (person: Person) => {
    return `Hey ${person.name}, congrats on 
    turning ${age}!`;
}

sayHappyBirthday({name: 'Luke', age: 29});
