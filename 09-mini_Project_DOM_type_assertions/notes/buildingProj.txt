Since we're going to manipulate the DOM, 
we need an index.html file, and also we need 
to get the full set up for the project, that 
way we don't need to use 'tsc' every time we, 
make a change

1. In root of project folder run 'tsc --init' 
which creates the TS config file

2. Create a src folder, and a dist folder, src 
will house TS files, and dist will house JS files

3. Inside src create index.ts

4. Inside tsconfig.json change outDir to "./dist"

5. At bottom : }, "include": ["./src"]

6. Then in the integrated terminal run 'tsc -w" (This 
is how we can get TS to auto-compile JS on save, w/o 
watch mode enabled we'd need to run tsc every change)

7. Create an index.html file 

8. in root folder run: 'npm init -y" which 
creates the package.json

9. change the name in the package.json to all lower 
case, package.json "name": "value" the value 
should always be lowercase

10. run "npm install lite-server" which will auto show up 
in the package.json

11. In package.json, under scripts add: 
"start": "lite-server", so that when we run 
npm start it runs lite-server

12. In VSCODE there should be two terminals, one 
where TS is in watch mode which recompiles 
our TS into JS on save, and the second where 
we run "npm start" which will house the live server

13. Now if we make any changes in TS files, everything 
will auto update, and lite-server will serve up the 
web app, this is important to note, live-server with 
VSCODE is different, to serve up the full web app we 
need to use lite-server instead
