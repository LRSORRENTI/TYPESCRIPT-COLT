==========================
Type Assertions W/ the DOM
===========================

Back to the DOM, let's see an example where 
we can use a type assertion, let's add an 
input element in the HTML page 

Then when the user clicks the button, the value 
entered in the input field is stored in the todo list

Then erase the input field / reset it 

We use the 'as' keyword appended to the variables that 
are getting the getElementByID or getElementByClassName 

const btn = document.getElementById('btn')! as HTMLButtonElement;

const input = document.getElementById("todo")! as HTMLInputElement

// above we need to cast it using the 'as' keyword
 

 It also tells TS what exactly those values are in relation to 
 the DOM
